# **Project Description**

This project has an extremely simple ui, as the focus is on the backend. Allows creating appointments, booking appointments, and getting currently booked appointments (so far).

To use this with AWS, you will need to change the fetch url in the client to the ip in your AWS virtual machine.

<small>I will modify the UI and add more functionality soonish probably</small>
